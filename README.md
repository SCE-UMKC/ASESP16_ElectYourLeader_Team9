# ASESP16_ElectYourLeader_Team9
ASE Spring Semester project

Our project is "Elect Your Leader", where we have developed a web application which can replace the traditional voting system. Through 
our application voters and candidates contesting can register and once the registration is done voters can login and vote for the candidates
contesting in their location.
